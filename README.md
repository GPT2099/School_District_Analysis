# School District Analysis
An analysis of the "PyCity" school district's student performance as it relates to funding, school size, and school type using Pandas and ipython notebooks.

## Overview
This analysis will provide district executives key metrics of student performance based on past funding, school size, and school type to determine future funding. The key metrics that will be calculated are as follows:
- The District Summary
- The School Summary
- The Top Five Performing Schools Based On Overall Passing Rate
- The Bottom Five Performing Schools Based On Overall Passing Rate
- The Average Math Score For Each Grade level From Each School
- The Average Reading Score For Each Grade level From Each School
- The Scores By School Spending Per Student 
- The Scores By School Size
- The Scores By School Type
Additionally, this analysis will address the possibility of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School by their ninth graders. These scores will be omitted and we will describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
